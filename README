README for code associated with the paper "Identifying Causal Subsequent Memory Effects" by David J. Halpern, Shannon Tubridy, Lila Davachi and Todd M. Gureckis

Directories may need to be changed throughout and intermediate files are often created. Some jupyter notebooks may not be able to run all the way through in one shot if there is limited RAM.

behav_plots.R
Generates Figure 2, S11 and S12

dag.R
Generates and identifies independence assumptions in DAGs in figures S1-4

power_analysis.R
Generates Figure S13

preproc/
code for preprocessing the t-maps derived from fmriprep
run in the following order:
create_vox_coord_mapper.ipynb
create_roi_dfs.ipynb
create_classifier_rep_preproc_dfs.ipynb

models/
code for running models in Figures 5, 6, S14, S15
run glmer_item_test_loc_classifiers.R first to fit baseline IRT model
run_models.s provides a bash script for running all models on a cluster with SLURM scheduling
after fitting models, run load_perm_clf_files.R to aggregate permutation runs
clf_plot.R creates figures
